#Â How to contribute

Firstly, thank you!

There are a couple of ways you can contribute to the Jira CLI project.

* File a [bug](https://github.com/ptrbrynt/jira-cli/issues/new?assignees=ptrbrynt&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) or [feature request](https://github.com/ptrbrynt/jira-cli/issues/new?assignees=ptrbrynt&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md)
* Check through the [issues](https://github.com/ptrbrynt/jira-cli/issues) and see if there's anything you can resolve
    * If so, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ptrbrynt/jira-cli/compare)
    * If you're new here, you can use the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/ptrbrynt/jira-cli/labels/good%20first%20issue) filter to find issues that require minimal knowledge of the project

Remember, you don't always have to contribute code! If you spot a gap in the documentation and you can fix it, submit a pull request for that!

In all contributions, please ensure you follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Coding Standards

Broadly speaking we will accept code which passes the default [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) checks and is appropriately tested.
